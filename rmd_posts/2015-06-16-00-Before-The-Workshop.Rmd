Prior to the start of the workshop everyone will need to have the software 
installed and tested.  You will need to have the following installed (links are 
provided for Windows and Mac):

1. **R:** Get the latest versions and install using the default settings.
 - [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
 - [Mac]()
2. **RStudio:** Get the latest download and install using the default settings.
 - [Windows](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
 - [Mac](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
3. **Git:** 

Once everything is installed, follow the instructions below to test your installation.

## Open RStudio
Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu.  Start up RStudio.  Once running it should look something like:

![RStudio Window](/iale_open_science/figure/rstudio.png)

## Find "Console" window
By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio.  Find that window.  It will looking something like:  

![RStudio Console](/iale_open_science/figure/rstudio_console.png)

## Copy and paste the code
Click in the window and paste in the code from below:

```{r version, eval=FALSE}
version$version.string
```

## It should say...

```{r version, echo=FALSE}
version$version.string
```

## And Check on Git 
Lastly, let's make sure Git is running.  Can also do this from R with:

```{r version, eval=FALSE}
system("git --version")
```

## Which should looking something like...

```{r version, echo=FALSE}
system("git --version")
```
