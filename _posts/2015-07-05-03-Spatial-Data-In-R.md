Collaboration is essential to science, and requires understanding both the social side to collaboration as well as the logistical, nuts-and-bolts, technical side.  In spite of its importance, we get very little training in how to do this.  In this lesson we are going to start to focus on the technical side of collaboration.  Given the limited time we have, we are going to show you the bare bones of [GitHub](https://github.com) and the underlying version control technology, [Git](https://git-scm.com/).  

##Lesson Goals
- Understand Git and GitHub and how they work together
- Be able to use basic Git commands from the shell
- Be able to use RSutdio's Git interface
