<p>The workshop is designed around my own idea of what a common data analysis workflow would entail: get -&gt; clean -&gt; explore -&gt; visualize -&gt; analyze -&gt; repeat.  </p>

<p>I hope this workshop to be more hands-on exercises and less show and tell.  After the workshop you wonâ€™t be an expert but should have the foundation for getting started on your own data analysis work in R and will know where and how to get help. </p>

<p>This outline and way of thinking about teaching R is greatly influenced by both <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>.  I have borrowed a great deal of my inspiration from both places.</p>

<p>For each of the lessons there is a blog post that describes what we are doing, provides some examples and also provides some hands-on exercises.  I have written these as blog posts for use after the workshop.  Additionally, all of the code for each lesson is available as a stand alone R script.  During the workshop we will work mostly from the script.  </p>
